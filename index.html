        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>The Millbrook community works together to provide students opportunities to take risks in a safe, nurturing environment. We provide challenging experiences, which address the needs of the whole child while promoting responsibility, respect, and compassion for others.

            Millbrook’s vision is to foster thoughtful, caring, and creative students. They will be critical thinkers and problem solvers. Students will be confident, prepared for future success and achieve their academic and social potential.

            Evergreen School District, located in the City of San Jose, is comprised of eighteen elementary schools and three middle schools. Once a small farming city, San Jose became a magnet for suburban newcomers between the 1960s and the 1990s, and is now the third largest city in California. The city is located in Silicon Valley, at the southern end of the San Francisco Bay Area, and is home to more than 1,000,000 residents.

            Millbrook Elementary School is located on the east side of the district’s borders. Millbrook opened its doors in 1985 as the thirteenth school in our district. In the 2016-17 school year, the school served approximately 650 students in grades Kindergarten through six on a traditional calendar schedule.

            The school provides a family-oriented, nurturing, and safe place for students to learn, grow, and develop intellectually. Teachers, staff, and administrators continue to act on the principle that students come first.</p>
